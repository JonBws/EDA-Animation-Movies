# EDA-Animation-Movies

## Overview
In this project, I used a dataset about animation movies that I obtained from Kaggle to get deep information by visualizing this data in Python using Matplotlib and Seaborn. The first step for this project is to load the CSV into Python, and then I formulated some questions to answer based on this data

## Analysis
Here are some questions that need further analysis
1. What animated movie has the longest runtime?
2. What is the correlation between revenue and budget?
3. Are all animated movie for children ?
4. What is the correlation between revenue and runtime?
5. Which year had the most animated movie releases?
6. Which animated movie is the most popular?
7. Which animated genre is produced the most?
8. Which country is the driving force behind global animation?
9. What language is used the most in animated film production?
10. Do all animated films make a profit?

## Result

in the scatter plot, the plot points tend to increase from left to right, this shows that there is a positive relationship between budget and reviews, meaning that the bigger the budget, the bigger the revenue. There are also several outliers that can be observed in the scatter plot, where there are films with high budgets but generating little revenue

### 3. Are all animated movie for children ?
